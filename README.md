Implement the ExtendedDate class by inheriting it from the standard one class Date and adding the following features:

• a method for displaying the date (day and month) as a text;

• the method to check is the past date or the future (if passed, then the method returns false; if future or current, then - true);

• method for checking whether it is a leap year or not;

• a method that returns the next date.

Create an ExtendedDate object and display the results work of new methods.
